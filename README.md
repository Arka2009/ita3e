# ita3e : What is it ?
1. C Implementation of Algorithms described in 3rd Edition of Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest
2. Strives to adhere to GNU-C Coding standards

# ita3e : Objectives ?
1. Analysis and practical implementation algorithms and data structures in C (sort of).
   For self learning mostly
2. Analysis of performance (space, time, cache misses, multithreading, power, memory leaks) etc.
   For self learning mostly
3. Developing and verifying bounds of algorithms
   For self learning mostly
4. This is not for production codebase, so usual software development concepts
   like OOP, Inheritance, generic programming etc. are strictly kept out of the discussion.
   Look at a similar Java/Scala/C++/Python implementation for such issues.
5. The level of abstraction in other words in resticted to C, any
   higher level programming abstraction is avoided. The basic objective is to keep
   the abstractions as low as possible to understand how programs behave
   under the hood.
