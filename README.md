# ita3e : What is it ?
A collection of Agorithms in topics as diverse as computational geometry, 
scientific computing, quantitative finance, physics simulations, statistics, 
bioinformatics, DSP, EDA etc. 

- [ita3e : Objectives ?](#Objectives)
1. Learning Practical (sort of) implementation of algorithms and data structures in C/C++.
2. Complexity Analysis (cache, time and space) and its verification.
3. Parallel Computing and Parallel Implementation (pthreads, openMP, Intel TBB and cilk)
   also includes scheduling, load balancing and mapping problems.
4. Performance Analysis (cache misses, energy and timing) (aka Benchmarking).

- [Skill required/acquired](#skills)
1. Strong Coding Skills in C/C++
2. Debuggers like gdb and valgrind
3. Build tools like GNU-Make / CMake 


3. Timing and Energy Analysis for resource contrained and safety critical systems
4. Learning th.
5. This is not for production codebase, so usual software development concepts
   like OOP, Inheritance, generic programming etc. are strictly kept out of the discussion.
   Look at a similar Java/Scala/C++/Python implementation for such issues.
6. The level of abstraction in other words in resticted to C, any
   higher level programming abstraction is avoided. The basic objective is to keep
   the abstractions as low as possible to understand how programs behave
   under the hood.
