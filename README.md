# ita3e : What is it ?
A collection of Agorithms in topics as diverse as computational geometry, 
scientific computing, quantitative finance, physics simulations, statistics, 
bioinformatics, DSP, EDA etc. 

- [ita3e : Objectives ?](#Objectives)
1. Learning Practical (sort of) implementation of algorithms and data structures in C/C++.
2. Complexity Analysis (cache, time and space) of algorithms.
3. Benchmarking, Energy and power analyses of applications.
4. Act as a testbed for the following
	4.1 Kernel/Application benchmarking.
	4.2 Inspect code generation and assembly code quality
	4.3 Use of tools like gdb, valgrind etc.
5. Not meant to be a production codebase. So dont expect rigorous 
   software development techniques to be applied consistently.
6. The level of abstraction is resticted to C, any
   higher level programming abstraction are to be avoided. 
   The basic objective to understand how programs behave under the hood.
   process.

- [Skill required/acquired](#skills)
1. C programming in the UNIX environment.
2. C based parallel programming frameworks and libraries 
   (pthreads, openMP, Intel TBB and cilk)
3. Learn task/thread level parallelism as well as SIMD
   and data level parallelism, underlying these frameworks.
   Try to understand the compiler optimizations (IR level and below) and
   code generation process.
4. Debuggers like gdb and valgrind.
5. Build tools like GNU-Make / CMake.
6. Computer System Security
